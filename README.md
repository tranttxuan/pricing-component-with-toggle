This is my response to a front-end coding challenge from Frontend Mentor. 

This challenge was to build out a pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

Users should be able to:

  . View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size

  . Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
